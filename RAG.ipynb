    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation \n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) is a technique used to retrieve relevant contextual information from a data source and passing that information to a large language model alongside the user’s prompt. This information is used to improve the model’s output (generated text or images) by augmenting the model’s base knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is valuable for use-cases where the model needs knowledge which is not included in the information the model has learned from. For example, consider using GPT as chatbot for an e-commerce wesite, where users can interact with the model to get information about products. The GPT model has no knowledge about the company's products and services, and when a user asks questions about information on products the model would be incapable of answering or it would provide incorrect information (called hallucination), since the model hasn't been trained on the product information. Hence, to prevent such scenarios and augment the model's knowledge which would enable the model to generate relevant responses we implement RAG.\n",

    "* A corpus of documents that are not used to train the model are stored as vector representation(Embeddings) in vector store for faster retrieval. These documents are used to augment the model's context while answering user queries that the model has no knowledge about\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user query is converted to vector representation and a similarity search is performed on the vector store to retrieve the documents that are related to the user query\n",
    "\n",
    "* These documents are provided as context to the Large Language Model for response generation\n"
